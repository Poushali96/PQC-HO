# Workload data

`pqc_profiles_reported.csv` contains the three workload tiers used by the frozen V3 experiment on seeds 7001–7020. Payload size is the sum of the KEM public key and ciphertext, signature public key and signature, and 600 bytes of protocol overhead. Edge work is ML-KEM decapsulation plus ML-DSA verification.

The timing values were produced with Open Quantum Safe/liboqs 0.16.0 using 2,000 repetitions in the source notebook. They are machine-dependent. The original notebook output did not preserve a detailed CPU model, so new measurements should be accompanied by hardware and software metadata.
